This is a small game that I created working with Udemy course called "The complete Javascript course: From Zero to expert" made by Jonas Schmedtmann.
Idea of the game is to guess the number between 1 and 20 which was randomly generated by the game. You have 20 tries before the score goes to 0 and you lose the game. If your guess is lower than the actual number, game tells you "too low". If the guess is higher than the actual number, game tells you "too high". 
When you guess the number, game tells you "Correct number" and sets a highscore, which stays the same until you guess the number in less tries. 
In the upper left corner there is a button "Again" where you can play the game again and all resets, except the highscore number. Highscore only resets if the browser is reloaded.
HTML and CSS was made by the course teacher and just copied here.
